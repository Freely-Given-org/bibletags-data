### Open source alignment data

If you are aware of any open source word alignment data (what we call Bible tags) for a particular Bible translation, please [bring it to our attention](https://bibletags.org/contact) and we will gladly make use of it. Both full alignment data, as well as data which simply includes the Strongs number, lexeme or lemma for each word in the translation, are useful.
